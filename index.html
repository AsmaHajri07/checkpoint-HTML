            <h1> About </h1>
<p> The About section on your profile is designated for a statement that expresses your mission, motivation, and skills to people who view your profile.  </p>
      <p> Example of an about section:My passion for education comes from my experience as a student who confronted my own learning differences. This journey has led me to appreciate the complexity and nuance of learning and pursue a career supporting teachers and advancing opportunities for at risk students. I have leveraged technology and innovative pedagogy to improve literacy in K-12 education. I steadfastly believe that listening closely and compassionately to educators is the best way to improve student outcomes and build thriving organizations in the education ecosystem.

        Listening is a research proven foundation for literacy but few schools and districts treat listening with the same purpose as reading and writing. This comes on the heels of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) that mandates listening as an anchor standard; at least 22 states that now assess listening; and workforce preparedness studies which show that listening ranks as a top 3 workforce readiness skill.
        
        Listenwise, through its partnership with NPR, has built a repository of over 2,000 curriculum aligned podcasts in ELA, social studies, science and current events for students in grades 2-12. Our Lexile Framework for Listening is the first research based, objective measurement for teachers to assess student listening ability, monitor growth, and provide appropriate audio materials to assist students in improving their listening skills.</p>
